* Add 'introduction' section on vol details
* Ability to remove/hide volunteers
* Does it make sense to have date coloured red without alert icon?
* Alert icon tooltip on mobile? Need to touch to get alert popup
* Error message tooltip: just show message, also mobile popup behaviour
* When cancelling from "Add new volunteer", should go back to previously selected volunteer?
* Next/previous 4 weeks should load shifts on demand? (For future if data starts getting too big)
